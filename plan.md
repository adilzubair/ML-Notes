Research Plan: Application of Novel Snapshot-Based Hyperspectral Imaging Combined with AI to Detect Lesions

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Background

The detection and analysis of lesions across a wide variety of tissues are critical in medical diagnostics and treatment planning. Traditional imaging techniques, while effective, often lack the capability to provide detailed spectral information necessary for identifying subtle physiological changes. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) offers a solution by capturing both spatial and spectral information from an object, thus enabling the identification of materials based on their spectral signature. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning, with HSI, can further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of lesion detection.

#### 1.2 Research Objectives

- To develop a novel snapshot-based hyperspectral imaging system for acquiring high-resolution spectral images.
- To create an AI-driven framework for analyzing hyperspectral data, aimed at accurately detecting and classifying lesions.
- To assess the effectiveness of the combined HSI-AI system in detecting lesions in a variety of tissues, compared to traditional imaging methods.

### 2. Materials and Methods

#### 2.1 Development of the Hyperspectral Imaging System

- **Design and Construction**: Outline the technical specifications for the snapshot-based HSI device, including sensor types, spectral range, and resolution.
- **Calibration and Validation**: Establish protocols for calibrating the HSI system and validating its performance using known spectral signatures.

#### 2.2 AI Model Development

- **Data Collection**: Compile a diverse dataset of hyperspectral images, both healthy and with lesions, across different tissues.
